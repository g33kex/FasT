This is a general-purpose Newtonian physics simulator that can simulate falls in different fluids, collisions, and gravitational attraction. The simulator also renders a webpage with documentation explaining the physics behind the simulated phenomena. 

I made it as part of my TPE (Travaux Personnels Encadr√©s) in eleventh grade.
